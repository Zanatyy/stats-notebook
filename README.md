## Installation
To run this notebook, ensure you have Jupyter installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas statsmodels sklearn scipy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the notebook:

cd stats-notebook
jupyter notebook 1.Descriptive-Statistics.ipynb
```

## Descriptive Statistics
This section includes an overview of key concepts:
- **Central Tendency**: Measures like mean, median, and mode.
- **Dispersion**: Measures including range, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Frequency Distribution**: Methods to represent data distribution.
- **Graphs**: Various visualizations to illustrate data characteristics.

## Elementary Statistical Tests
Overview of basic statistical tests:
- **Parametric Tests**: Includes one-sample tests, two-sample dependent tests, and two-sample independent tests.
- **Nonparametric Tests**: Discusses alternatives to parametric tests.

## Regression and Correlation
Introduction to regression analysis:
- **Linear Correlation**: Examining relationships between variables.
- **Linear Regression**: Modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable.
- **Multiple Regression**: Extending linear regression to include multiple independent variables.

## Conclusions
A summary of the findings from the analyses, highlighting insights gained from descriptive statistics and statistical tests, along with recommendations for further study.
